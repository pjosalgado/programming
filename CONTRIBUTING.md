## How Contribute to This Project
Here are 3 quick and painless ways to contribute to this project:

* Add a program in any language. (A simple Hello World would be suffice.)
To do so, first create an issue with the task you are doing. For Ex. Issue - creating bubble sort in C. Add the HacktoberFest label in the issue and assign the issue to yourself. Create a pull request in response to that issue and finally submit it for review.

* How to name your branch?
	username_hello_world_in_c

	Also create a directory for any new programs if it doesn't exist.
	ex. hello_world, bubble_sort.
	Inside these directories you can create your own file with program_name.language_extension (hello_world.cpp)

Finally, wait for it to be merged!
