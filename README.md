## How To Contribute to This Project
Here are 3 quick and painless steps to contribute to this project:

* Add a program in any language. (A simple Hello World would suffice.)
To do so, first create an issue with the task you are doing, for example: "Issue - creating bubble sort in C". Add the `HacktoberFest` label in the issue and assign the issue to yourself. Create a pull request in response to that issue and finally submit it for review.

* Name your branch `username_hello_world_in_c`.

	Also create a directory for any new program if it doesn't exist.
	eg. `hello_world`, `bubble_sort`.
	Inside these directories you can create your own file named `program_name.language_extension` (`hello_world.cpp`)
	Create a commit of the form - fixes #(issue_number)

* Finally, wait for it to be merged!
